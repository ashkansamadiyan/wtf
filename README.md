This is not a benchmark nor a micro benchmark my dear dudes! this is just a simple experiment ok ?! 

NOTE: I know there are better implementations (especially in go with channels magics) but i was trying to mimic what we actually ship! 


**.gitignore** ?:
no there is no .gitignore because i wrote a bashscript to just do all the cargo cleans and mod purges (rm -rf node_modules lol) and the push, soooo the script purged itslef LOL
i was drunk man and this experiment wouldn't be a thing if i wasn't, anyways on next commit there might be a 'target' or 'venv' pushed! i dont care at this point! am i still drunk ? ofcourse i am! and yes i dod wash my credit card with soap! (if you know you know)



so there are READMEs in each sub directories (probably), but the scripts are simple so who cares!


hey jeremy, check legend state man, its like giving react heroine and overdose immunity! 


# spoiler alert
please run the scripts then read this!
===================================================
so my conclusion :
did you really ran the scripts tho? seriously don't ruin the fun run them XD

really tho, i came to results that we don't hate js (i refuse to say ts since number is type!!!! yea fuk uint8, who needs 8 bit numbers when you can just say x:number)
anyways js is the best thing as long as it stays in browser. with that said, we all still do nextjs in front :)

anyways, the result that i concluded is that we don't hate js, we hate js developers who just do npm install everything with out any idea of what that library does, the devs who have no idea they can change the library and so on!

anyways good libraries in ts are made but actually smart people and good devs who would do all the rust and go and c better than us if they devoted! but they need to make money on x !
